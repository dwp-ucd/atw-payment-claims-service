            <p>You can include multiple receipts or invoices when scanning or taking photos of receipts or invoices.
              This will save you time when it comes to uploading them later on. </p>

              <p>Your receipts or invoices must show:</p>
              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>the amount paid for the support worker</li>
                  <li>the support worker's full name</li>
                  <li>the dates the support worker provided support</li>
                  <li>a short description of the support they provided</li>
              </ul>


            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Taking photos of receipts or invoices</h2>
            <p>Make sure:</p>

                <li>you include the whole receipt or invoice in the image</li>
                <li>you take the photo from above and not at an angle</li>
                <li>the photo is not blurry</li>
            </ul>
